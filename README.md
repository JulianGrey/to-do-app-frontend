# To Do App

A small To Do App project that acts as a continuation of building my knowledge of React, as well as working on and improving knowledge of best practices, as well as test creation of React projects.

This will be further extended with a backend which will control the functionality, separating the responsibility of the frontend to being UI only, and minimising as much business logic as possible.
