# To Do App Frontend

The centrepiece of my website is what I call the "Navgrid", a crossword-style navigation which shows different content depending on which word you click.

The frontend is powered by React + Vite, and hosted on AWS Amplify. The deployment is fully automated when a push to GitHub's main branch is detected, and the website is deployed inside Amplify.

Back in 2014 this was purely desktop, as I failed to come up with a functional design or method to make the feature work on a smaller screen. However eleven years later nine years into my career, I was able to use a technique that I learnt and implemented into the mobile site of an online casino to get around this issue. The button and modal combo, simple yet effective.
